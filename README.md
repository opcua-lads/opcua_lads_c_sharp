# LADS workshop - LADS LuminescenceReader (C# with foundation libraries)

This is an OPC-UA server running the LuminescenceReader nodeset to help people get started on [LADS OPC-UA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lads-opc-ua/) server.

> **Attention:** It is currently using a modified version of the LADS nodeset (to use the model compiler from the foundation).

## Installation

The project is a simple .NET 8 console application. It can be opened and compiled with your prefered IDE (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider, ...)
The nuget dependencies should be installed automatically (OPC Foundation libraries and Serilog) and you only have to build it.

## Usage

Start the server project.
